## 💻 Project

OJmoney is a web app to manage transactions made in your day to day life. This App was developed during Ignite Bootcamp taught by RocketSeat and a few extra feature were added by myself, those being a SearchBar and Transactions types filter. Currently it uses miragejs techlogy which allows me to use a fake database, in the future, a real API is gonna be developed as well as login with authentication and a profile page.
